        <p>
            Inspired by global travel and disappointed by veggie burgers that play second fiddle to their meaty counterparts, Veggie Burger Guy aims to bring big satisfying taste sensations to those looking for a guilt free burger fix.
        </p>
        <p>
            Following visits to various street food markets across London and the UK, Oli spotted a common theme, a poor selection for vegetarians and vegans. He set out to make a veggie burger that could easily satisfy a meat eater both in terms of taste and texture.
        </p>
        <p>
            Using ingredients sourced in south London, Veggie Burger Guy prepares a selection of the tastiest patties from fresh. Served up with matching sauces and slaw in a seeded bap, all veggie burgers are vegan friendly and big on flavour.
        </p>
        <p>
            All patties are delicately spiced and inspired by flavours from Thai and Jamaican to Moroccan and Mexican. Try them all and tell me which is your favourite!
